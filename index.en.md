##





```shell
ssh-keygen -t rsa -q -C "For SSH" -f rsa_id
```



```shell
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh remote_username@server_ip_address "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

Solution

## It is found that the OpenSSH authentishing agent it is not started. The design is clear, that is, it is user, ice is turned on, the attempt is strong unable to connect agian.
